Intake Take2
============

*Taking the pain out of data access and distribution*

Intake is an open-source package to:

- describe your data declaratively
- gather data sets into catalogs
- search catalogs and services to find the right data you need
- load, transform and output data in many formats
- work with third party remote storage and compute platforms

This is the start of the documentation for the alpha version of Intake: Take2, a
rewrite of Intake (henceforth referred to as legacy or V1). We will give an
introduction to the ideas of Intake in general and specifically how to use this
release. Go directly to the walkthrough and examples, or read the following motivation
and declarations of scope.

.. warning::

    Looking for :ref:`v1` documentation? You may have justin installed Intake and found that
    V2 broke things for you, so you might wish to pin to an older version.
